Cron Setup Instructions
------------------------
1. Set Up Your Virtual Environment:
    Create a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies (e.g., google-generativeai) in it.
    For example:

        cd ~
        python3 -m venv myenv       # Replace 'myenv' with your desired venv name
        source myenv/bin/activate
        pip install google-generativeai

2. Edit Rootâ€™s Crontab:
   Since the script writes to /etc/motd, it needs to run with root privileges. Edit root's crontab by running:

        sudo crontab -e

   At the top of the file, add any required environment variables (optional) and your cron entry.
   For example, if you want the script to run every day at 11 AM PST, add:

        # Set timezone to Pacific Time
        TZ=America/Los_Angeles

        # Run the script at 11 AM PST daily.
        0 11 * * * /home/your_username/myenv/bin/python /home/your_username/path/to/verses.py >> /var/log/verses.log 2>&1

   Notes:

   Replace /home/your_username/myenv/bin/python with the full path to your virtual environment's Python interpreter.
   Replace /home/your_username/path/to/verses.py with the full path to the script.
   The output is redirected to /var/log/verses.log for logging; you can change or remove this as needed.

3. Ensure Cron Is Running:
   Verify that the cron daemon is active:

        sudo systemctl status cron
